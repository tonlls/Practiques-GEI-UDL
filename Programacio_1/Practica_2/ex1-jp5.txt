The goal of the GNU ecadfcbcb project is to produce a Unix-compatible accbbbdef operating system consisting entirely of free software, and most general-purpose Linux distributions rely on GNU libraries and tools written to that effect, The Free Software Foundation views these Linux distributions as "variants" of the GNU system, facebbdcb and asks that such operating systems abbbccdef be referred baaecdcbf to as GNU/Linux or a Linux-based GNU system, While some distributions make a point of using the eebcdcacb combined form - notably Debian GNU/Linux - its use outside of the enthusiast community is limited, and Linus Torvalds has said that he finds calling Linux in general GNU/Linux "just ridiculous",[5] The distinction between the Linux kernel and distributions based cfcabcdba on it is a source of confusion to many newcomers, and the abbccdeff naming remains controversial.
